- **Smart Templates**: Leverage smart templates for ChatGPT to create customized trip plans based on user preferences.
- **Quick and Efficient**: Users receive a complete and personalized trip itinerary in just 2-3 minutes, saving them time and effort while ensuring a memorable and well-organized travel experience.
- **Interactive Waiting Page**: While waiting for the response, users can engage with riddles. If the user clicks to know the answer, another riddle switches the current one until the response is received.

## Demo

This demo showcases one trip that the user can search for. This trip is hard-coded and does not include server-side processing.

### Main Page

The main page includes a form where users can input their preferences. Once the form is submitted, it is sent to the server. While waiting for the response, the user is taken to a waiting page.

### Waiting Page

On the waiting page, users are presented with riddles to keep them engaged. If the user clicks to see the answer, another riddle replaces the current one, and this continues until the response is received.

### Response Page

The response is split into sections:

- **Daily Plans**: Each day is divided into morning, noon, and evening sections, each featuring attractions and restaurants with related images.
- **Map**: At the end of the itinerary, a map with the route is provided.
